# Stage 06 – Web UI/UX Delivery (Apps)

1. Produce high-level mockups (Figma) inspired by DeFi dashboards: dark theme, card grids, sparkline charts.
2. Build Next.js route `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` with responsive layout using shadcn/ui primitives and Tailwind tokens.
3. Create widgets: Yield table with risk badges, APY delta chart, Wormhole fee panel, watchlist sidebar, and recommendation callouts.
4. Add portfolio simulation modal for hypothetical allocations (no execution) with real-time recalculation of Expected APY vs Net APY.
5. Validate accessibility through keyboard traversal, focus outlines, descriptive aria labels, and color contrast audits.
