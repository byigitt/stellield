# Connect Your Wallet

Stellield uses Privy for secure, flexible wallet authentication. This guide covers all available connection methods.

## Supported Wallet Options

### External Wallets (Recommended)
- **MetaMask**: Most popular Ethereum wallet
- **Coinbase Wallet**: User-friendly option with mobile support
- **WalletConnect**: Connect any WalletConnect-compatible wallet
- **Rainbow**: Modern, user-friendly Ethereum wallet

### Embedded Wallet
- **Email-based**: Create a wallet secured by your email
- No browser extension required
- Automatically created during sign-up

## Connecting with an External Wallet

### Step 1: Click Connect Wallet

In the top-right corner of the header, click the **"Connect Wallet"** button.

### Step 2: Choose Your Wallet

A modal will appear with available wallet options. Select your preferred wallet provider.

### Step 3: Approve Connection

Your wallet extension will prompt you to:
1. **Approve the connection** to Stellield
2. **Sign an authentication message** (no gas required)

> **Security Note**: The signature request does NOT give Stellield permission to move your funds. It only proves you own the wallet address.

### Step 4: Verify Network

Ensure your wallet is connected to **Ethereum Sepolia Testnet**:

- **Chain ID**: 11155111
- **RPC URL**: https://rpc.sepolia.org
- **Currency**: SepoliaETH

If you're on the wrong network, you'll see a warning indicator in the header. Click to switch networks automatically.

## Creating an Embedded Wallet

### Step 1: Select Email Option

When connecting, choose the **"Continue with Email"** option.

### Step 2: Enter Your Email

Provide a valid email address where you can receive verification codes.

### Step 3: Verify Email

Check your inbox for a verification code and enter it in the prompt.

### Step 4: Wallet Created

Your embedded wallet is automatically created and secured by Privy. The wallet address will be displayed in your profile.

## Security Best Practices
