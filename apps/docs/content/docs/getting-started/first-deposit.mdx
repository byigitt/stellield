# Making Your First Deposit

Learn how to evaluate opportunities and deposit funds into Stellar DeFi protocols through Stellield.

## Important: Information-Only Platform

> **No Auto-Execution**: Stellield does NOT execute trades or custody funds. We provide analytics and insights only. Actual deposits must be made directly through the protocol's interface using your own wallet.

## Before You Deposit

### 1. Understand the Opportunity

Review the following details for each yield opportunity:

- **Protocol Name**: The DeFi protocol offering the yield
- **Asset**: The token you need to deposit (USDC, XLM, etc.)
- **Current APY**: The present annual percentage yield
- **Expected APY**: AI-projected APY based on historical data
- **Risk Tier**: A-D classification (see [Risk Tiers](/docs/risk/risk-tiers))
- **TVL**: Total Value Locked in the protocol
- **Liquidity Depth**: Available liquidity for exits
- **24h Change**: Recent performance trend

### 2. Check Risk Tier

Understanding risk is crucial:

  <Card title="Tier B" description="Medium risk - Established protocols with good security and moderate liquidity" />
  <Card title="Tier C" description="Higher risk - Newer protocols or those with lower liquidity" />
  <Card title="Tier D" description="High risk - Experimental protocols requiring careful consideration" />
</Cards>

### 3. Verify Protocol Details

Before depositing:
1. Visit the protocol's official website
2. Read their documentation
3. Check for security audits
4. Review smart contract addresses
5. Understand withdrawal procedures

## Using the Platform

### Step 1: Browse Opportunities

On the **Dashboard** or **Yields** page, you'll see cards displaying available opportunities:

```
Soroban AMM
USDC
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Net APY: 9.48%
Expected APY: 10.2%
TVL: $9,481,000
Risk Tier: A
24h Change: +7.76%
Liquidity: $10M+
```

### Step 2: Review Details

Click **"View Details"** on any opportunity card to see:

- **Full protocol description**
- **Historical performance charts**
- **Risk score breakdown**
- **Smart contract addresses**
- **Audit reports** (if available)
- **Direct link to protocol**

### Step 3: Use Portfolio Simulator

Before committing real funds, test your strategy:

1. Navigate to **Portfolio** tab
2. Enter your intended deposit amount
3. Select your risk tolerance
4. View AI recommendations
5. Run simulations to project outcomes

### Step 4: Access the Protocol

When ready to deposit:

1. Click the protocol link from the opportunity card
2. You'll be redirected to the protocol's official interface
3. Connect your wallet directly to the protocol
4. Follow their deposit procedures

## Example: Depositing to Soroban AMM

### On Stellield:
1. Review Soroban AMM opportunity card
2. Note the 9.48% APY and Tier A risk
3. Confirm $10M+ liquidity
4. Read protocol details

### On Soroban AMM (External):
1. Visit the Soroban AMM website
2. Connect your wallet
3. Select the USDC pool
4. Enter deposit amount
5. Approve USDC spending (if first time)
6. Confirm deposit transaction
7. Wait for blockchain confirmation

### Back on Stellield:
1. Your position won't show here (we don't track individual wallets)
2. You can monitor the protocol's overall performance
3. Use our analytics to decide when to withdraw

## Deposit Checklist

Before making any deposit, verify:

- [ ] You understand the protocol's mechanism
- [ ] You've reviewed the risk tier and scoring
- [ ] You're comfortable with the risk level
- [ ] You've checked recent performance (24h/7d)
- [ ] You know how to withdraw your funds
- [ ] You've verified the protocol's smart contract
- [ ] You have enough for gas fees
- [ ] You're not depositing more than you can afford to lose

## Monitoring Your Investment

While Stellield doesn't track individual positions, you can:

### Monitor Protocol Health
- Check TVL changes (growing = healthy)
- Review APY trends (stable = good)
- Watch risk score updates
- Track liquidity depth

### Use Market Overview
- View overall Stellar DeFi TVL
- Track average APY across protocols
- Monitor risk distribution changes
- Check 24h volume trends

### Set Personal Alerts
- Bookmark opportunities you're invested in
- Check daily for risk tier changes
- Monitor for protocol announcements
- Watch for bridge cost changes (if planning exits)

## Understanding Fees

Be aware of various fees:

### Protocol Fees
- **Deposit Fee**: Some protocols charge on entry (usually 0%)
- **Performance Fee**: Percentage of earned yield (varies by protocol)
- **Withdrawal Fee**: Fee to exit (check before entering)

### Blockchain Fees
- **Gas Fees**: Transaction costs on Stellar (very low, ~$0.0001)
- **Network Congestion**: Can temporarily increase costs

### Bridge Fees (if cross-chain)
- See our [Bridge Cost Estimator](/docs/bridge/overview)
- Factor these into total cost of capital

## Withdrawal Strategy

Plan your exit before entering:

### Consider:
- **Lock-up periods**: Some protocols have time locks
- **Liquidity**: Can the protocol handle your exit size?
- **Gas costs**: Withdrawal fees on top of protocol fees
- **Market timing**: APY changes may signal time to move

### Best Practices:
- Don't deposit more than protocol liquidity allows
- Keep some funds liquid for emergencies
- Diversify across multiple protocols (reduces risk)
- Review positions weekly, not daily

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

> **Chasing High APY**: Higher yields often mean higher risk. Always check risk tier.

> **Ignoring Liquidity**: Low liquidity can trap your funds during market stress.

> **Skipping Research**: Never deposit based solely on APY numbers.

> **Forgetting Gas**: Keep ETH/XLM for transaction fees.

> **FOMO**: Don't rush. Opportunities will always exist.
