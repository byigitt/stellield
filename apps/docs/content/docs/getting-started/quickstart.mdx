- An email address for account creation
- Some XLM or ETH to start exploring opportunities

## Step 1: Visit the Platform

Navigate to [Stellield Dashboard](https://stellield.app/dashboard) to access the main application.

## Step 2: Connect Your Wallet

Click the **"Connect Wallet"** button in the top-right corner of the header.

### Option A: Use Your Existing Wallet

2. Approve the connection request in your wallet
3. Sign the authentication message

### Option B: Create an Embedded Wallet

2. Verify your email via the code sent to your inbox
3. Your wallet will be automatically created and secured

> **Note**: Currently, the platform is configured for Ethereum Sepolia Testnet. Make sure your wallet is connected to the correct network.

## Step 3: Explore Yield Opportunities

Once connected, you'll see the main dashboard with several sections:

### Market Overview

## Step 4: Understand Risk Scores

Each opportunity is classified with a risk tier:
