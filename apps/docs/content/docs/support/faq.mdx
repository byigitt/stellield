# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

**Q: What is Stellield?**
A: Stellield is an AI-powered yield aggregator for Stellar Network. We help you discover, analyze, and optimize DeFi yield opportunities with comprehensive risk assessment.

**Q: Does Stellield custody my funds?**
A: No. Stellield is information-only. We provide analytics and insights. You maintain full control of your assets at all times.

**Q: Does Stellield execute trades automatically?**
A: No. We do not execute any trades. All transactions must be performed manually through your wallet and the respective protocols.

**Q: Is Stellield free to use?**
A: Yes, the platform is currently free. We do not charge any fees for viewing data or using our tools.

## Wallet & Account

**Q: What wallets are supported?**
A: MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, WalletConnect-compatible wallets, and our embedded email-based wallet via Privy.

**Q: Why am I seeing "Wrong Network"?**
A: The platform is configured for Ethereum Sepolia Testnet (Chain ID: 11155111). Switch your wallet to this network.

**Q: How do I get testnet ETH?**
A: Use a Sepolia faucet like sepoliafaucet.com or faucet.quicknode.com

**Q: Can I use multiple wallets?**
A: Yes, disconnect your current wallet and connect a different one. Each wallet has its own session.

## Risk & Safety

**Q: What do risk tiers mean?**
A: Tier A (lowest risk) to Tier D (highest risk). See [Risk Tiers](/docs/risk/risk-tiers) for details.

**Q: How accurate are risk scores?**
A: Our models have 87% accuracy based on historical backtesting. However, they cannot predict all risks, especially unprecedented events.

**Q: Should I only invest in Tier A?**
A: Not necessarily. Higher tiers offer higher yields. Diversify based on your risk tolerance.

**Q: What if a protocol gets exploited?**
A: Risk tiers update automatically. We recommend monitoring your holdings daily and diversifying across multiple protocols.

## Yields & APY

**Q: Why do APYs change?**
A: Yields fluctuate based on supply/demand, protocol incentives, and market conditions. Updates occur every 10 minutes.

**Q: What's the difference between Net APY and Expected APY?**
A: Net APY is current on-chain rate. Expected APY is our AI prediction for the next 7 days.

**Q: Are APYs guaranteed?**
A: No. APYs are historical or projected rates. Actual returns may vary significantly.

**Q: Do yields include fees?**
A: Displayed APYs are typically pre-fee. Factor in protocol fees, gas costs, and potential slippage.

## Bridge

**Q: Which bridge should I use?**
A: For USDC, use Circle CCTP ($0 fees). For XLM to Ethereum, use Soroban Bridge. For multi-chain, use Wormhole.

**Q: How long does bridging take?**
A: 3-15 minutes typically, depending on bridge and chain congestion.

**Q: Can I cancel a bridge transfer?**
A: No, bridging is irreversible once initiated. Double-check all details before confirming.

**Q: What are wrapped tokens?**
A: Wrapped tokens (like wXLM) represent native assets on different chains. They're backed 1:1 and redeemable.

## Portfolio Simulator

**Q: Is the simulator accurate?**
A: Simulations are estimates based on historical data. They cannot predict future market conditions perfectly.

**Q: Can I save my simulations?**
A: Not currently. Simulations are session-based only.

**Q: Why doesn't my actual portfolio show?**
A: Stellield doesn't track individual wallet positions. Use the simulator to model strategies.

## Technical

**Q: Why is data sometimes delayed?**
A: We update most metrics every 10 minutes. Some sources may have additional latency during high load.

**Q: Can I access an API?**
A: Not currently public. Contact us for enterprise API access.

**Q: Is the platform mobile-friendly?**
A: Yes, responsive design works on mobile browsers. Native apps are planned.

**Q: Why am I seeing loading errors?**
A: Check your internet connection. If persistent, try refreshing or clearing cache.
