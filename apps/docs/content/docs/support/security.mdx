# Security Best Practices

Protect your crypto assets with these essential security guidelines.

## Wallet Security

### Use Strong Passwords

✅ **Do**:
- 12+ characters
- Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- Unique password per service
- Use a password manager

❌ **Don't**:
- Reuse passwords
- Use simple patterns (abc123)
- Share passwords
- Store in plain text

### Secure Your Seed Phrase

> **Critical**: Your seed phrase is your wallet. Anyone with it can steal all your funds.

✅ **Do**:
- Write it down on paper (never digital)
- Store in secure physical location (safe, bank)
- Create multiple copies in different locations
- Consider metal backup for fire/water resistance

❌ **Don't**:
- Save in cloud storage
- Take screenshots
- Email or message to anyone
- Enter into websites (except official wallet recovery)
- Share with anyone (not even "support")

### Enable 2FA

Where available:
- Email accounts (critical for embedded wallets)
- Exchange accounts
- Wallet provider accounts
- Privy authentication

**Use**: Authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy)
**Avoid**: SMS 2FA (SIM swap attacks possible)

### Hardware Wallets (Most Secure)

**Recommended**:
- Ledger Nano S/X
- Trezor One/Model T
- GridPlus Lattice1

**Benefits**:
- Private keys never leave device
- Sign transactions offline
- Immune to computer malware

**Setup**: Connect hardware wallet to MetaMask for Stellield use

## Phishing Protection

### Verify URLs

> **Always check you're on the real site before connecting wallet**

✅ **Correct**: `https://stellield.app`

❌ **Fake Examples**:
- `stellield.com` (wrong TLD)
- `stellield-app.com`
- `stellield.app.phishing.com`
- `stel1ield.app` (1 instead of l)

**Tips**:
- Bookmark official site
- Check for HTTPS and lock icon
- Verify certificate details

### Recognize Phishing Attempts

**Red Flags**:
- Urgent messages ("Act now or lose funds!")
- Requests for seed phrase or private keys
- Too-good-to-be-true offers
- Suspicious emails from "support"
- Unknown links in DMs

**Remember**:
- Stellield will NEVER ask for your seed phrase
- Stellield will NEVER ask for your private keys
- Stellield support won't DM you first
- We won't ask you to send funds anywhere

### Email Security

**Be Cautious Of**:
- Emails claiming to be from Stellield
- Requests to "verify" your wallet
- Links to "urgent security updates"
- Attachments from unknown senders

**Verify**:
- Check sender email domain
- Hover over links (don't click) to see real URL
- Contact official channels if suspicious

## Transaction Safety

### Before Signing Any Transaction

1. **Read carefully** what you're approving
2. **Verify recipient** address is correct
3. **Check amount** matches your intention
4. **Understand permissions** you're granting
5. **Confirm gas fees** are reasonable

### Token Approvals

**Unlimited Approvals** (common but risky):
- Allow protocol to spend unlimited tokens
- Convenient but dangerous if protocol is compromised
- Consider using exact amounts instead

**Revoke Old Approvals**:
- Use tools like revoke.cash
- Remove permissions for protocols you no longer use
- Reduces attack surface

### Simulation Tools

**Before confirming**:
- Use wallet simulation features (MetaMask warnings)
- Check what assets will be moved
- Verify contract interactions

## Browser Security

### Keep Software Updated

- Browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- Wallet extensions
- Operating system
- Antivirus software

**Why**: Security patches fix vulnerabilities

### Use Dedicated Browser Profile

**For Crypto**:
- Create separate browser profile
- Install only necessary extensions
- Avoid visiting unrelated sites
- Clear regularly

**Benefits**:
- Isolate crypto activity
- Reduce malware exposure
- Limit tracking

### Dangerous Extensions

❌ **Avoid**:
- Unknown/unverified extensions
- Extensions with excessive permissions
- Browser extensions from unofficial stores

✅ **Install Only**:
- Official wallet extensions (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet)
- From official browser stores
- Verified publishers

## Network Safety

### Public WiFi Risks

**Never on public WiFi**:
- Access wallet
- Sign transactions
- Enter passwords or seed phrases

**Use Instead**:
- Home network
- Trusted private WiFi
- Mobile data (cellular)
- VPN if must use public WiFi

### VPN Recommendations

**Benefits**:
- Encrypt internet traffic
- Hide IP address
- Protect on untrusted networks

**Reputable VPN Providers**:
- Mullvad
- ProtonVPN
- IVPN

**Avoid**: Free VPNs (often sell your data)

## Smart Contract Interaction

### Before Using Any Protocol

1. **Research thoroughly**:
   - Check for audits
   - Read documentation
   - Review team background
   - Check community sentiment

2. **Verify contracts**:
   - Use block explorers (Stellar Expert, Etherscan)
   - Confirm contract addresses match official docs
   - Check contract is verified (source code published)

3. **Start small**:
   - Test with minimal amounts first
   - Verify functionality works as expected
   - Scale up gradually

### Red Flags

❌ **Warning Signs**:
- No audit reports
- Anonymous team
- Promises of unrealistic returns
- Pressure to invest quickly
- Unverified contracts
- Very new protocols (<1 month)

## Stellield-Specific Security

### What Stellield Can Access

✅ **Stellield CAN**:
- See your wallet address (public information)
- Show your balance (reads from blockchain)

❌ **Stellield CANNOT**:
- Move your funds (no custody)
- Execute transactions without your approval

## Incident Response

### If You Suspect Compromise

**Immediate Steps**:
1. **Disconnect wallet** from all dApps
2. **Transfer funds** to new, secure wallet
3. **Revoke approvals** on old wallet
4. **Scan device** for malware
5. **Change passwords** on all accounts

**Do NOT**:
- Panic and send funds to unverified "recovery" services
- Share details in public channels
- Reuse the compromised wallet

### If You're Scammed

1. **Document everything**:
   - Transaction hashes
   - Wallet addresses involved
   - Screenshots of communications
   - Timestamps

2. **Report**:
   - Local law enforcement (if significant amount)
   - Blockchain explorers (flag addresses)
   - Community (warn others)

3. **Learn**:
   - How did it happen?
   - How to prevent in future?
   - Share your experience (anonymously) to help others
