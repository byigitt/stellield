## Tier Comparison Table

## How Tiers Are Calculated

Risk tiers use a weighted scoring system across 5 dimensions:

```
Total Score = 
  (Protocol Integrity × 35%) +
  (Liquidity & Execution × 25%) +
  (Performance Stability × 15%) +
  (Network & Custody × 15%) +
  (Operational Signals × 10%)
```

### Score to Tier Mapping

- **≥3.0**: Tier A
- **1.0 to 2.9**: Tier B
- **-1.5 to 0.9**: Tier C
- **<-1.5**: Tier D

See [Scoring Methodology](/docs/risk/scoring-methodology) for details.

## Tier Changes

Risk tiers are updated hourly and can change based on:

- **Security events**: Exploits, pauses, or upgrades
- **Performance**: Sustained APY changes
- **Liquidity**: TVL or depth fluctuations
- **Audits**: New security reviews
- **Age**: Protocols maturing over time

**Notifications**: Stellield alerts users to tier changes for protocols in their watchlist.

### For Tier B

- Balanced risk/reward
- Diversify across multiple B protocols
- Monitor monthly
- Be ready to exit if downgraded

### For Tier C

- Small allocations only
- Monitor weekly
- Have exit strategy ready
- Understand protocol mechanics fully

### For Tier D

- Experimental capital only
- Monitor daily
