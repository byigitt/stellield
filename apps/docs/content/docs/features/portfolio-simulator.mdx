# Portfolio Simulator

Test different portfolio allocation strategies using historical data and AI predictions without risking real funds.

## Overview

The Portfolio Simulator allows you to:
- **Test strategies** with different risk tolerances
- **Compare outcomes** across allocation models
- **Get AI recommendations** with confidence scores
- **Understand metrics** like Sharpe ratio and max drawdown
- **Simulate time periods** to see historical performance

## Key Metrics

### Expected APY
AI-projected annual percentage yield based on:
- Historical performance patterns
- Current market conditions
- ML model predictions
- Risk-adjusted returns

### Net APY
Current on-chain yield across your simulated allocations:
- Real-time rates from protocols
- Weighted by allocation percentages
- Updated every 10 minutes

### Risk Score
Portfolio-wide risk classification (Tier A-D):
- Weighted average of individual opportunities
- Considers concentration risk
- Accounts for correlation

### Sharpe Ratio
Risk-adjusted return measure:
- **>2.0**: Excellent risk-adjusted returns
- **1.5-2.0**: Good returns for the risk taken
- **1.0-1.5**: Moderate risk/reward balance
- **&lt;1.0**: High risk for the expected return

Formula: `(Portfolio Return - Risk Free Rate) / Standard Deviation`

### Max Drawdown
Largest historical decline from peak:
- **&lt;10%**: Low volatility, stable yields
- **10-25%**: Moderate fluctuations
- **>25%**: High volatility, unstable yields

### Liquidity Score
Exit capacity rating (0-100):
- **90-100**: Can exit entire position easily
- **70-89**: Minor slippage expected
- **50-69**: Significant slippage on large exits
- **&lt;50**: Limited exit capacity

## Using the Simulator

### Step 1: Set Risk Tolerance

Choose your risk profile:

#### Conservative (Tier A Only)
- Focus on audited, established protocols
- Lower expected returns (5-8% APY)
- Minimal volatility
- High liquidity
- **Best for**: Capital preservation with some yield

#### Moderate (Tier A-B)
- Mix of proven and established protocols
- Balanced returns (8-12% APY)
- Moderate volatility
- Good liquidity
- **Best for**: Most investors seeking steady income

#### Aggressive (All Tiers)
- Includes newer, higher-yield opportunities
- Higher expected returns (12-20%+ APY)
- Significant volatility
- Variable liquidity
- **Best for**: Experienced users comfortable with risk

### Step 2: Adjust Allocation

Use the slider to set your Stellar allocation (0-100%):

- **100% Stellar**: All funds in Stellar ecosystem
- **50% Stellar**: Balanced with other chains
- **30% Stellar**: Minor Stellar exposure

Remaining allocation can be:
- Other blockchain opportunities
- Stablecoin reserves
- Traditional assets

### Step 3: Choose Optimization Mode

#### AI Optimize (Recommended)
Let our ML models suggest allocations:

```
AI Recommended Allocation:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Soroban AMM (USDC)     35%
Aquarius Rewards       25%
Stellar DEX LP         20%
StellarX Savings       20%
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Confidence Score: 87%
```

**How AI Optimizes**:
1. Analyzes historical correlations between protocols
2. Maximizes Sharpe ratio for your risk tolerance
3. Ensures diversification across asset types
4. Considers current market conditions
5. Factors in liquidity constraints

**Confidence Score** indicates:
- **>85%**: High confidence in recommendation
- **70-85%**: Moderate confidence
- **&lt;70%**: Low confidence, manual review suggested

#### Manual
Set custom percentages for each protocol:
- Full control over allocations
- Test specific hypotheses
- Override AI suggestions
- Useful for experienced users

#### Compare
Side-by-side comparison:
- AI recommendation vs. your manual allocation
- Different risk tolerance levels
- Historical vs. projected performance

### Step 4: Enter Simulation Amount

Input the amount you want to simulate:

```
Simulation Amount: 10,000 XLM
≈ $1,100 USD

Quick amounts:
[1K] [10K] [100K]
```

**Note**: This is simulation only. No funds are moved.

### Step 5: Run Simulation

Click **"Run Simulation"** to see projected outcomes:

#### Results Include:
- **1-Year Projection**: Expected portfolio value
- **APY Range**: Min/max expected yields
- **Risk Metrics**: Volatility, drawdown estimates
- **Fee Impact**: Estimated costs
- **Comparison**: vs. market average

- **Best-case scenarios** (99th percentile)
- **Median outcome** vs. mean

## Best Practices

### Before Simulating

1. **Set realistic goals**: Don't chase unrealistic APYs
2. **Consider time horizon**: Longer = more stable projections
3. **Account for taxes**: Include tax implications
4. **Factor in opportunity cost**: vs. other investments

### Interpreting Results

> **Projections ≠ Guarantees**: Simulations are estimates based on historical data.

> **Market Changes**: Future conditions may differ significantly from the past.

> **Model Limitations**: AI cannot predict unprecedented events.

### When to Rebalance

Simulator suggests rebalancing when:
- **Risk tier changes**: Protocol moves up or down a tier
- **Performance divergence**: >20% from expected APY
- **Liquidity drops**: Liquidity score falls below 70
- **Better opportunities**: New protocols with higher risk-adjusted returns
