# Risk Assessment System

Stellield employs a multi-dimensional risk assessment framework to evaluate every yield opportunity, providing you with transparent, data-driven risk scores.

## Risk Tier Classification

Every opportunity receives a letter grade from A to D:

<Cards>
  <Card title="Tier A - Low Risk" description="Audited protocols, deep liquidity, proven track record. Suitable for conservative investors." />
  <Card title="Tier B - Medium Risk" description="Established protocols with good security. Suitable for moderate risk tolerance." />
  <Card title="Tier C - Higher Risk" description="Newer or less liquid protocols. Requires careful consideration." />
  <Card title="Tier D - High Risk" description="Experimental protocols. Only for experienced users comfortable with significant risk." />
</Cards>

## Five Risk Dimensions

### 1. Protocol Integrity (35% Weight)

The most important factor measuring trust and security:

#### Security Audits
- **Multiple audits** from top firms (CertiK, Trail of Bits, etc.): +2 points

- **>1 year**: +1.5 points
- **6-12 months**: +0.5 points
- **3-6 months**: 0 points
- **<3 months**: -1 point

#### Team Transparency
- **Doxxed team** with track record: +1 point
- **Anonymous but active**: 0 points
- **Inactive or unknown**: -1 point

- **5-10% capacity**: 0 points
- **<5% capacity**: -1 point

### 3. Performance Stability (15% Weight)

Historical consistency and predictability:

#### APY Volatility
- **<2% std deviation** (30-day): +1 point
- **2-5% std deviation**: 0 points
- **>5% std deviation**: -1 point

#### Drawdown History
- **Max drawdown <10%**: +1 point
- **10-25% max drawdown**: 0 points
- **>25% max drawdown**: -1.5 points

#### Prediction Confidence
- **ML model confidence >85%**: +1 point
- **70-85% confidence**: +0.5 points
- **<70% confidence**: 0 points

### 4. Network & Custody (15% Weight)

Chain-level and custody security:

#### Network Security
- **Stellar (PoS, mature)**: +1 point
- **Established L2**: +0.5 points
- **Newer chain**: -0.5 points

#### Custody Model
- **Non-custodial, user keys**: +1 point
- **Smart contract custody**: 0 points
- **Centralized custody**: -2 points

#### Oracle Risk
- **Chainlink or decentralized**: +0.5 points
- **Single oracle**: -1 point
- **No oracle needed**: +0.5 points

### 5. Operational Signals (10% Weight)

Real-time health indicators:

#### User Activity
- **Growing user base** (30-day): +1 point
- **Stable users**: 0 points
- **Declining users**: -1 point

#### TVL Trend
- **Growing TVL** (30-day): +1 point
- **Stable TVL**: 0 points
- **Declining TVL**: -0.5 points

#### Community Engagement
- **Active Discord/Twitter**: +0.5 points
- **Inactive community**: -0.5 points

## Scoring Algorithm

### Total Score Calculation

```typescript
totalScore = 
  (protocolIntegrity * 0.35) +
  (liquidity * 0.25) +
  (stability * 0.15) +
  (network * 0.15) +
  (operational * 0.10)
```

### Tier Thresholds

| Total Score | Risk Tier | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| ≥3.0 | A | Low Risk |
| 1.0 to 2.9 | B | Medium Risk |
| -1.5 to 0.9 | C | Higher Risk |
| <-1.5 | D | High Risk |

## Additional Risk Factors

### Impermanent Loss Risk

For liquidity pool opportunities:

- **Stablecoin-Stablecoin**: IL Risk = No
- **Stablecoin-Volatile**: IL Risk = Moderate
- **Volatile-Volatile**: IL Risk = Yes

IL Risk lowers the score by 2 points.

### Exposure Type

- **Single-Chain**: +0.5 points
- **Multi-Chain**: -0.5 points (additional bridge risk)

### Token Rewards

- **Established tokens** (XLM, USDC): 0 points
- **New tokens**: -0.5 points (dump risk)
- **Vesting schedules**: +0.5 points

## Risk Score Updates

Risk scores are recalculated:

- **Hourly**: For real-time metrics (TVL, volume, activity)
- **Daily**: For market data and trends
- **Weekly**: For ML model predictions
- **On Event**: Security incidents, audits, major changes

## Viewing Risk Details

## Portfolio Risk Analysis

### Aggregated Risk Score

Your portfolio risk grade considers:
- **Allocation weights**: Larger positions have more impact
- **Correlation**: Diversification benefits
- **Concentration**: Single-protocol exposure limits

### Risk Distribution Formula

```typescript
portfolioGrade = (
  (countTierA * 4) +
  (countTierB * 2) -
  (countTierC * 1) -
  (countTierD * 2)
) / totalOpportunities
```

### Grade Mapping

| Score | Grade | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| ≥3.2 | A | Very Low Risk |
| 1.5-3.1 | B+ | Low-Medium Risk |
| 1.0-1.4 | B | Medium Risk |
| 0.2-0.9 | B- | Medium-High Risk |
| -0.5 to 0.1 | C | Higher Risk |
| <-0.5 | C- | High Risk |

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Diversification

- **Multiple Tiers**: Spread across A/B opportunities
- **Multiple Protocols**: Don't concentrate in one protocol
- **Multiple Assets**: Different underlying tokens

### Position Sizing

- **Tier A**: Up to 40% of portfolio
- **Tier B**: Up to 25% of portfolio
- **Tier C**: Up to 15% of portfolio
- **Tier D**: Up to 5% of portfolio (advanced users only)

### Monitoring

- **Daily**: Check for risk tier changes
- **Weekly**: Review performance vs. expectations
- **Monthly**: Rebalance based on risk shifts

## Limitations

> **Not Financial Advice**: Risk scores are informational tools, not investment recommendations.

> **Historical Data**: Models use past data, which may not predict future events.

> **External Factors**: Cannot account for regulatory changes, black swan events, or market manipulation.

> **Human Review**: Scores are partially automated but include editorial judgment.
