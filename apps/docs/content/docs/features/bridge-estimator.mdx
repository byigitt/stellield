# Bridge Cost Estimator

Accurately estimate the total cost of moving assets across chains with our comprehensive bridge cost calculator.

## Supported Bridges

Stellield tracks three major bridge options for cross-chain transfers:

  <Card title="Circle CCTP" description="$0 protocol fees - Native USDC transfers" />
  <Card title="Soroban Bridge" description="Official Stellar Foundation bridge" />
  <Card title="Wormhole" description="Multi-chain guardian network" />
</Cards>

## How to Use

### Step 1: Select Bridge

Choose from available bridge options:

- **Circle CCTP**: Best for USDC transfers
- **Soroban Bridge**: For XLM ↔ Ethereum (wXLM)
- **Wormhole**: For Solana and Polygon routes

### Step 2: Enter Amount

Input the amount you want to bridge in XLM:

```
Amount: 1,000 XLM
≈ $110 USD

[Max] button sets to wallet balance
```

### Step 3: Review Estimate

See complete cost breakdown:

```
Notional:        1,000 XLM ($110.00)
Bridge Fee:      $0.00
Gas Cost:        $0.12
Slippage:        $0.06
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Total Cost:      $0.18 (0.16%)
Est. Received:   $109.82
Effective Cost:  16 basis points
```

## Cost Components

### 1. Bridge Fee

Protocol-level fees charged by the bridge:

| Bridge | Base Fee | Variable Fee |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| CCTP | $0.00 | 0 bps |
| Soroban | $2.50 | 20 bps |
| Wormhole | $1.80 | 15 bps |

**Calculation**: `Base Fee + (Amount × Variable Fee / 10,000)`

### 2. Gas Costs

Transaction execution fees on destination chain:

| Bridge | Base Gas | Variable Gas |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| CCTP | $0.12 | 5 bps |
| Soroban | $1.50 | 7 bps |
| Wormhole | $2.80 | 8 bps |

**Why Variable?**:
- Larger amounts require more gas for verification
- Complex transactions cost more
- Network congestion can increase costs

### 3. Slippage Buffer

Expected price movement during transfer:

| Bridge | Slippage |
|--------|----------|
| CCTP | 5 bps |
| Soroban | 20 bps |
| Wormhole | 25 bps |

**Note**: Actual slippage may be lower. This is a conservative estimate.

### 4. Total Cost

Sum of all components:
```
Total = Bridge Fee + Gas + Slippage
Effective Cost (bps) = (Total / Amount) × 10,000
```

## Bridge Comparison

### Circle CCTP

**Best For**: USDC transfers between supported networks

**Advantages**:
- ✅ $0 protocol fees
- ✅ Native USDC (no wrapped tokens)
- ✅ Burn & mint mechanism
- ✅ Fast settlement (~5 minutes)
- ✅ High volume capacity

**Disadvantages**:
- ❌ Only supports USDC
- ❌ Limited to specific chains
- ❌ Requires gas on both chains

**Supported Routes**:
- Stellar ↔ Ethereum
- Stellar ↔ Base
- Stellar ↔ Avalanche
- Stellar ↔ Solana

### Soroban Bridge

**Best For**: XLM and Stellar assets to Ethereum

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Official Stellar Foundation bridge
- ✅ Audited smart contracts
- ✅ Custody verification
- ✅ Supports native Stellar assets

**Disadvantages**:
- ❌ Higher fees than CCTP
- ❌ Only Ethereum destination
- ❌ Creates wrapped tokens (wXLM)
- ❌ Custody window (~5 minutes)

**Supported Routes**:
- Stellar ↔ Ethereum

### Wormhole

**Best For**: Multi-chain strategies, Solana routes

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Widest chain support
- ✅ Guardian network security
- ✅ Fast finality (~3 minutes)
- ✅ High liquidity

**Disadvantages**:
- ❌ Moderate fees
- ❌ Wrapped asset complexity
- ❌ Guardian trust assumptions
- ❌ Higher gas costs

**Supported Routes**:
- Stellar ↔ Solana
- Stellar ↔ Ethereum
- Stellar ↔ Polygon

## Size Recommendations

### Minimum Amounts

| Bridge | Minimum | Reason |
|--------|---------|--------|
| CCTP | $10 | Protocol minimum |
| Soroban | $25 | Fee efficiency |
| Wormhole | $50 | Guardian costs |

**Below minimum**: Fees eat too much of your transfer.

### Maximum Amounts

| Bridge | Maximum | Reason |
|--------|---------|--------|
| CCTP | None | Deep liquidity |
| Soroban | None* | Custody varies |
| Wormhole | None* | Per-route limits |

*Check with bridge operator for large transfers (>$100k)

### Optimal Range

**$1,000 - $50,000**: Sweet spot for most bridges where:
- Fees are <0.5% of transfer
- Liquidity is abundant
- Settlement is fast
- Slippage is minimal

## Time Estimates

Average time to complete bridge transfers:

| Bridge | Time | Steps |
|--------|------|-------|
| CCTP | 5-10 min | Burn → Attest → Mint |
| Soroban | 5-15 min | Lock → Verify → Release |
| Wormhole | 3-8 min | Lock → Guardian → Unlock |

**Factors affecting time**:
- Source chain finality
- Destination chain congestion
- Guardian/validator response time
- Your gas price (if applicable)

## Live Bridge Stats

The estimator shows real-time metrics:

### 24h Volume
How much was bridged in the last 24 hours:
- Indicates liquidity availability
- Higher volume = more reliable
- Shows network health

### 7d Volume
Weekly bridge activity:
- Trend indicator
- Capacity verification
- Market sentiment

### Previous Day Transactions
Number of transfers completed:
- Activity level
- User confidence
- Operational status

## Cost Optimization Tips

### Choose the Right Bridge

1. **For USDC**: Always use CCTP ($0 fees)
2. **For XLM**: Soroban Bridge to Ethereum
3. **For Solana**: Wormhole is fastest
4. **For multiple hops**: Calculate total cost

### Batch Transfers

Instead of many small transfers:
- **Bad**: 10 × $100 = $1.80 total fees
- **Good**: 1 × $1,000 = $0.18 total fees

**Savings**: 10x more cost effective

### Timing

Bridge during off-peak hours:
- **Ethereum**: Late night/early morning UTC
- **Lower gas**: Weekends typically cheaper
- **Less slippage**: Lower volume periods

### Amount Sweet Spots

Some amounts have better effective costs:

```
$50:    2.0% effective cost
$500:   0.4% effective cost ← Better
$5000:  0.2% effective cost ← Best
$50000: 0.15% effective cost
```

## Warnings & Limits
