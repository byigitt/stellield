# Bridge Cost Comparison

Compare costs, speeds, and features across all supported bridges to find the best option for your needs.

## Quick Comparison Table

| Bridge | Asset | Min Amount | Base Fee | Variable Fee | Avg Time | Chains |
|--------|-------|------------|----------|--------------|----------|--------|
| **CCTP** | USDC | $10 | $0 | 0% | 5-10 min | 5+ |
| **Soroban** | XLM | $25 | $2.50 | 0.20% | 5-15 min | ETH only |
| **Wormhole** | Any | $50 | $1.80 | 0.15% | 3-8 min | 20+ |

## Cost Examples

### Small Transfer ($100)

| Bridge | Protocol Fee | Gas | Total | Effective % |
|--------|--------------|-----|-------|-------------|
| CCTP | $0.00 | $12 | $12.00 | 12.0% ❌ |

**Winner**: Wormhole (most chains)

## Use Case Recommendations

### For USDC Transfers

**Best Choice**: Circle CCTP

**Why**:
- $0 protocol fees
- Native USDC (no wrapping)
- Widely supported
- Trusted by Circle

### For XLM to Ethereum

**Best Choice**: Soroban Bridge

**Why**:
- Official Stellar Foundation
- Audited and trusted
- Direct XLM support

### For Multi-Chain Strategies

**Best Choice**: Wormhole

**Why**:
- 20+ chains supported
- Fast transfers
- High liquidity
- Flexible routing

### For Large Amounts (>$10k)

**Best Choice**: CCTP (USDC) or Wormhole (others)

**Why**:
- Lowest effective cost %
- Deep liquidity
- Battle-tested

## Decision Tree

```
Need to bridge? → What asset?

USDC → CCTP (always)

XLM → Where to?
  ├─ Ethereum only → Soroban Bridge
  └─ Other chains → Wormhole

Other asset → Wormhole
```

## Hidden Costs to Consider

### Gas Price Volatility

Ethereum gas can vary 10x:
- **Low** (10 gwei): ~$3
- **Medium** (50 gwei): ~$15
- **High** (100 gwei): ~$30

**Tip**: Bridge during off-peak hours (late night UTC)

### Slippage

Not included in estimates:
- CCTP: Minimal (stablecoin)
- Soroban: ~20 bps
- Wormhole: ~25 bps

### Opportunity Cost

While bridging (5-15 min), you:
- Can't earn yield
- Might miss price movements
- Lock capital

## Advanced: Multi-Hop Strategies

### Example: Stellar → Solana → Ethereum

**Option A (Two Bridges)**:
1. Stellar → Solana (Wormhole): $2
2. Solana → Ethereum (Wormhole): $5
3. Total: $7, 10-15 minutes

**Option B (Direct)**:
1. Stellar → Ethereum (Soroban or Wormhole): $18-28
2. Total: $18-28, 5-15 minutes

**Analysis**: Direct is faster but costlier. Multi-hop saves money for large amounts.

## FAQ

**Q: Which bridge is safest?**
A: CCTP (backed by Circle) and Soroban (Stellar Foundation) have highest trust.

**Q: Why don't you support Bridge X?**
A: We focus on most liquid, trusted bridges. Suggest additions via Discord.

**Q: Can I cancel a pending bridge?**
A: No, bridging is one-way. Ensure details are correct before confirming.

**Q: What if gas spikes mid-transfer?**
A: Destination claim may fail. You'll need to retry with higher gas.
